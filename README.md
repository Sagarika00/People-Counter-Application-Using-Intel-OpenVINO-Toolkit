# Deploy a People Counter App at the Edge

The people counter application demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using IntelÂ® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count. This project is a part of Intel Edge AI for IOT Developers Nanodegree program by udacity.
