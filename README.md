# Deploying a People Counter App at the Edge

The people counter application demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count. This project is a part of Intel Edge AI for IOT Developers Nanodegree program by udacity.

### How it works?

The counter will use the Inference Engine included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit. The model used should be able to identify people in a video frame. The application should count the number of people in the current frame, the duration that a person is in the frame (time elapsed between entering and exiting a frame) and the total count of people. It then sends the data to a local web server using the Paho MQTT Python package.

### Explaining Model Selection & Custom Layers
 
TensorFlow Object Detection Model Zoo (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) contains many pre-trained models on the coco dataset. Ssd_inception_v2_coco and faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco performed good as compared to rest of the models, but, in this project, faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco is used which is fast in detecting people with less errors. Intel openVINO already contains extensions for custom layers used in TensorFlow Object Detection Model Zoo.
